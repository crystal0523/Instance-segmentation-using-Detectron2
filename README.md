# Instance-segmentation-using-Detecron2
The purpose of this project is to implement a model for the task of instance segmentation using Tiny PASCAL VOC dataset. Detectron2 platform is used for this task. In particular, the model used is Mask R-CNN with ResNet50 as backbone. ImageNet pre-trained weights are used as a starting point for training
